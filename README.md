# Unit 18 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the `Develop` folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

# Workout Tracker
# Description
This is a workout tracker that uses a Mongoose Schema and Express. It allows you to view, create, and track daily workouts. You can log multiple exercises on any given day. You can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the resistance exercises. If you do a cardio exercise, you can track the distance traveled. This app should help a consumer meet their fitness goals more quickly by allowing them a way to track and view their progress.
